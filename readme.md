✅ 1. User Service
Handles:

Sign up / login

Authentication (JWT or Firebase Auth)

User profile (dietary preferences, allergies)

Why first?
Everything else (scans, personalization) depends on a user account.

✅ 2. Ingredient Database Service
Handles:

Ingredient info (name, description, benefits, harms)

Aliases/synonyms

Dietary tags (vegan, halal, allergen, etc.)

E-code mappings (e.g., E415 = xanthan gum)

Why second?
Needed for resolving ingredients from OCR output.

✅ 3. Scan Upload & OCR Service
Handles:

Image upload

OCR processing (e.g., via Google Vision API or Tesseract)

Returns raw text or objects from label

Why third?
Forms the core input pipeline for recognizing ingredients.

✅ 4. Ingredient Resolver Service
Handles:

Tokenizing OCR output

Matching to known ingredients in the DB

Normalizing text (e.g., remove %, caps, extra spaces)

Why next?
Translates raw OCR into usable, structured data.

✅ 5. Personalization Engine
Handles:

Matching ingredients to user profile

Calculating safety/warning flags

Highlighting allergens, dietary violations, etc.

Why now?
It enriches results shown to the user and is the key differentiator.

✅ 6. Scan History & Analytics Service
Handles:

Storing past scans for each user

Calculating ingredient exposure over time

Providing trends and health nudges

Why?
Nice layer for long-term retention and personalization.

✅ 7. Admin CMS / Content Panel
Handles:

Adding/editing ingredient info

Moderating flagged ingredients

Managing references/studies




✅ 1. Ingredient Extraction & Normalization:
Yes, you should handle this as a service, because OCR text is often messy.

✳️ Why you need your own service:
OCR returns inconsistent text ("sugar,sodium benzoate water...").

Some words may be misspelled, abbreviated, or have multiple names.

You may want to:

Clean punctuation

Standardize names (e.g., "ascorbic acid" → "vitamin C")

Split on delimiters like commas, semicolons, slashes

Remove duplicates

This gives you control and lets your backend work reliably.

✅ 2. Ingredient Knowledge Base API:
You can use ChatGPT API or similar to fetch descriptions/benefits/harms — BUT:

🔍 Pros of using GPT (like gpt-4 or gpt-3.5-turbo API):
Dynamic, detailed explanations

No need to manually build a giant ingredient database

Can answer things like: “Is X safe during pregnancy?”

⚠️ Cons:
Cost per request (per ingredient, can get expensive)

Latency: slower than DB lookups

Inconsistency: different wording every time unless controlled

No filtering: harder to filter by vegan/gluten/etc. without logic

✅ Best Approach: Hybrid Model
What	How
Common ingredients (top 5000)	Store in DB (MongoDB/PostgreSQL/SQLite)
Rare/unknown ingredients	Fallback to GPT API
First-time GPT results	Cache/save them in DB for reuse
Normalization	Handle in Node.js service (NLP)

✅ Tech Stack Suggestion
Component	Tech
Ingredient Parser	Node.js + Regex or NLP (compromise, natural)
Normalization/Mappings	JSON/DB mapping table
Knowledge API	DB + GPT fallback
Caching GPT results	Redis or DB with “ingredient → result”
