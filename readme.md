‚úÖ 1. User Service
Handles:

Sign up / login

Authentication (JWT or Firebase Auth)

User profile (dietary preferences, allergies)

Why first?
Everything else (scans, personalization) depends on a user account.

‚úÖ 2. Ingredient Database Service
Handles:

Ingredient info (name, description, benefits, harms)

Aliases/synonyms

Dietary tags (vegan, halal, allergen, etc.)

E-code mappings (e.g., E415 = xanthan gum)

Why second?
Needed for resolving ingredients from OCR output.

‚úÖ 3. Scan Upload & OCR Service
Handles:

Image upload

OCR processing (e.g., via Google Vision API or Tesseract)

Returns raw text or objects from label

Why third?
Forms the core input pipeline for recognizing ingredients.

‚úÖ 4. Ingredient Resolver Service
Handles:

Tokenizing OCR output

Matching to known ingredients in the DB

Normalizing text (e.g., remove %, caps, extra spaces)

Why next?
Translates raw OCR into usable, structured data.

‚úÖ 5. Personalization Engine
Handles:

Matching ingredients to user profile

Calculating safety/warning flags

Highlighting allergens, dietary violations, etc.

Why now?
It enriches results shown to the user and is the key differentiator.

‚úÖ 6. Scan History & Analytics Service
Handles:

Storing past scans for each user

Calculating ingredient exposure over time

Providing trends and health nudges

Why?
Nice layer for long-term retention and personalization.

‚úÖ 7. Admin CMS / Content Panel
Handles:

Adding/editing ingredient info

Moderating flagged ingredients

Managing references/studies




‚úÖ 1. Ingredient Extraction & Normalization:
Yes, you should handle this as a service, because OCR text is often messy.

‚ú≥Ô∏è Why you need your own service:
OCR returns inconsistent text ("sugar,sodium benzoate water...").

Some words may be misspelled, abbreviated, or have multiple names.

You may want to:

Clean punctuation

Standardize names (e.g., "ascorbic acid" ‚Üí "vitamin C")

Split on delimiters like commas, semicolons, slashes

Remove duplicates

This gives you control and lets your backend work reliably.

‚úÖ 2. Ingredient Knowledge Base API:
You can use ChatGPT API or similar to fetch descriptions/benefits/harms ‚Äî BUT:

üîç Pros of using GPT (like gpt-4 or gpt-3.5-turbo API):
Dynamic, detailed explanations

No need to manually build a giant ingredient database

Can answer things like: ‚ÄúIs X safe during pregnancy?‚Äù

‚ö†Ô∏è Cons:
Cost per request (per ingredient, can get expensive)

Latency: slower than DB lookups

Inconsistency: different wording every time unless controlled

No filtering: harder to filter by vegan/gluten/etc. without logic

‚úÖ Best Approach: Hybrid Model
What	How
Common ingredients (top 5000)	Store in DB (MongoDB/PostgreSQL/SQLite)
Rare/unknown ingredients	Fallback to GPT API
First-time GPT results	Cache/save them in DB for reuse
Normalization	Handle in Node.js service (NLP)

‚úÖ Tech Stack Suggestion
Component	Tech
Ingredient Parser	Node.js + Regex or NLP (compromise, natural)
Normalization/Mappings	JSON/DB mapping table
Knowledge API	DB + GPT fallback
Caching GPT results	Redis or DB with ‚Äúingredient ‚Üí result‚Äù
